A To-Do list is a list of tasks or activities that you need to complete. Each task is usually written down in a prioritized manner, helping you keep track of what needs to be done and ensuring that you donâ€™t forget any important tasks. This project focuses on creating a Python-based To Do List application with features like adding, viewing, removing  tasks and a graphical user interface. It is designed to demonstrate the practical application of programming concepts and cater to the diverse needs of users, making every day task management more efficient and personalized.
